Programs:

encode:
Reads a file specified as the first command-line argument, and encodes it using Huffman's algorithm. It writes output to the file given as the second comand line argument or stdout if no file is given.

decode:
Reads a file specified as the first command-line argument that was encoded by encode. Decodes the file and writes output to the file given as the second comand line argument or stdout if no file is given.


Files:

main.c:
Contains the main function for the encode and decode programs.
encode.c:
Contains definitions for functions used exclusively by the encode program.
decode.c:
Contains definitions for functions used exclusively by the decode program.
HuffmanTree.h:
Contains the type definition and function declarations for using the HuffmanTree data type.
functions.h:
Contains the function declarations for both encode and decode programs.
functions.c:
Contains definitions for the functions used by both programs.


As far as I know, there are no errors or bugs. It runs under valgrind with no errors or memory leaks.


I have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment.
